## Hey there!
I'm Karthik. I usually go by Axiss. This will probably look a lot better later down the line.
Mostly only worked on Hardware stuff, but I'm slowly getting here.
OS:GNU/Linux(EOS)

Known Languages:
Û∞êæPython: The only language I've worked with decently. Would not call myself proficient though.
Û∞êæC++: I've recently begun this, as you can see in my repositories.
Û∞êæHTML+CSS: I can do most of the basics, but not a lot more.

You can find me on Discord(axissprime), or my mail(axissprime@proton.me).
